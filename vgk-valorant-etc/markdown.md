# 5️⃣ TPM Chip



{% hint style="info" %}
**TPM stands for Trusted Computing Module.** A TPM Chip is necessary as Vanguard Anti-cheat abuses the TPM module to make hardware-id bans more difficult to bypass..
{% endhint %}

> **1.** Purchase a new TPM chip **(disable fTPM if u have that option in BIOS)**
>
> **2.** Make sure it is suitable with ur motherboard (we won't help with that)
>
> **3.** Install the new TPM chip before downloading Valorant, after woofing. _This is the best, most sustainable solution for legit players. Since any 'bypass' can unfortunately get patched at some point. A TPM chip can cost as little as 5$. Installation of TPM chips is VERY easy as well. It does not take technical knowledge._
